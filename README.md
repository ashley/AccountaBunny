##AccountaBunny

AccountaBunny prompts you every day to see if you have some time to make an impact. Depending on how long you are free, it will suggest an action (make a phone call, send an email) based on the issue you choose to tackle that day. In addition, you can add a custom call to action (organizing a local march) and that event will be sent to people near you.
